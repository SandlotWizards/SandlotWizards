# 🧙‍♂️ Sandlot Wizards

Hi, I'm **Shawn Taylor**, also known as `SandlotWizard`. With over 30 years of experience in software development, system architecture, and solution design, I’m now focused on building developer tools that blend modern AI with proven engineering discipline.

> 🧠 "It's not magic. It's just 30 years of figuring out what works — and teaching AI how to do it."

## ⚾ About the Name

**Sandlot Wizards** is a nod to my childhood roots (*The Sandlot*) and a compliment I got often in my career — "You're like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain." It captures who I am: scrappy, creative, and always focused on making something magical happen with code.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🛠️ `sandlot-pilot`: A local PowerShell + AI developer copilot for scaffolding .NET and multi-project solutions with structured prompts.
- 📦 Preparing my first [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages to share open source utilities.
- 🧪 Publishing reference architectures and utility apps (like `StepTrackerService`) that demonstrate real-world tooling in action.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- Dev automation with AI (ChatGPT, structured prompting, scaffolding)
- .NET Core / Blazor / EF Core / PowerShell integration
- Domain-Driven Design + Practical Architecture
- Software for manufacturing, logistics, quality, and field operations
